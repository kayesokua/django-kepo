# K.E.P.O ðŸ¤“

***Kepo*** is a Bahasa slang that stands for *Know Every Particular Object*, originating from the word ***Kaypoh*** (é¸¡å©†) in Hokkien.
Kepo is a word we can use to describe a very curious person, someone who wants to know everything, or how we may think of our relatives sometimes!

But there's nothing wrong with being ***kepo*** on things that matter most to you.

Kepo is a learning journal app designed to track your daily learnings and nurtures curious sharing.
It's a simple, dynamic website built with Python-Django 3.0 Framework. This repository contains the raw version of the project which may not follow the best practices, but a still decent starter template to help you setup a private learning network.

This project features:
 - My Feed: This app features Post (with file upload) and Comment forms, Posts List by User
 - My Journal: This app features a morning & evening journal forms, Calendar Display
 - My Account: This app includes basic user registration, authentication, change password, and updating account profile
 
 [Visit the demo app](http://kepo.pythonanywhere.com/) - Feel free to use this as your journal, no superuser was created for this demo.
